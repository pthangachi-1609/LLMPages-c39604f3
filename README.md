# LLMPages-c39604f3

A lightweight Flask-based project that can serve a small public assets site directly from a GitHub repository. It can also export all assets as static files for publishing on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.

## Project Summary

This repository contains a Flask app (app.py) that serves a set of public assets (text, JSON, SVG, etc.) and can also export a static version of these assets to a local directory. The assets cover a mix of fiction, data examples, and licenses to illustrate a simple, self-contained static site.

Key assets included or dynamically generated:
- ashravan.txt: 300–400 word Brandon Sanderson-inspired short story (Ashravan after Shai’s restoration)
- dilemma.json: Autonomous-vehicle moral scenarios with two test cases
- about.md: A three-word self-description
- pelican.svg: SVG image of a pelican riding a bicycle
- restaurant.json: Chennai restaurant recommendation data
- prediction.json: Fed Funds rate prediction (December 2025)
- index.html: Static site homepage linking to all assets
- LICENSE: MIT license text
- uid.txt: UID attachment content (read from embedded data if provided)

The app also provides a dynamic “Public Assets Home” and an attachment viewer at /uid.txt. It can export all assets into an output/ directory for GitHub Pages hosting.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (recommended)
- Basic Python and Pip installed

External dependencies:
- Flask (for the development server)

Optional (if you want to mirror requirements exactly):
- You can create a minimal requirements.txt with:
  - Flask>=2.0

If you don’t want to create a requirements file, install Flask directly:
- pip install Flask

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
   - git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLMPages-c39604f3.git
   - cd LLMPages-c39604f3

2. Prepare data.json (for uid.txt attachment)
   The code reads data.json to fetch attachments. If you want to serve a UID attachment, provide a data.json like:
   - Example data.json structure:
     {
       "attachments": [
         {
           "name": "uid.txt",
           "url": "data:text/plain;base64,BASE64_ENCODED_UID_CONTENT"
         }
       ]
     }
   - If data.json is missing or the attachment is not provided, /uid.txt will show a fallback message.

   Quick guide to create a base64 UID attachment:
   - echo -n "YOUR_UID_HERE" | base64
   - Insert the resulting string into the data.json URL field as shown above.

3. Install dependencies
   - If you have a virtual environment, activate it first.
   - pip install Flask

4. Data.json placement
   - The app expects a file named data.json at the repository root (same as app.py). If present, it can provide the uid.txt attachment content.

## Running the App

Development (dynamic) mode:
- Start the server:
  - python app.py
  - Or specify a port: PORT=8000 python app.py
- Access the app at http://localhost:5000/ (default port)

Static export mode (static site generation):
- Run with the export flag:
  - python app.py --export
- What happens:
  - The app renders and saves all assets into an output/ directory:
    - ashravan.txt
    - dilemma.json
    - about.md
    - pelican.svg
    - restaurant.json
    - prediction.json
    - index.html
    - LICENSE
    - uid.txt (from data.json if provided; otherwise a fallback)
  - After exporting, the process exits.

Hosting the static export:
- The content inside output/ can be pushed to a gh-pages branch or served by any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

Notes:
- The --export path is hard-coded to output/ in this project.
- If you use the static export, you’re generating a self-contained set of files for a public assets site.

---

## Usage Guide

- Development server:
  - Run: python app.py
  - Optional: set PORT via environment variable: PORT=8000 python app.py
  - The server runs in debug mode by default for development convenience (consult your environment for security implications in production).

- Dynamic asset access:
  - http://localhost:5000/ -> Public Assets Home (links to each asset)
  - /ashravan.txt -> 300–400 word Ashravan story
  - /dilemma.json -> dilemma.json content
  - /about.md -> short self-description in Markdown
  - /pelican.svg -> pelican.svg image
  - /restaurant.json -> restaurant data
  - /prediction.json -> rate prediction
  - /index.html -> homepage-like index
  - /uid.txt -> attachment content if provided via data.json

- Static export:
  - python app.py --export
  - Look in output/ for all generated files
  - Serve the output/ directory with any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

## Code Explanation

High-level structure of app.py:

- Data and content definitions
  - ASHRAVAN_STORY: A multi-paragraph narrative used for ashravan.txt
  - DILEMMA_JSON: A small JSON object describing two moral cases
  - ABOUT_MD: A short self-description in Markdown
  - PELICAN_SVG: SVG content for pelican.svg
  - RESTAURANT_JSON: Chennai restaurant data
  - PREDICTION_JSON: Fed Funds rate projection data
  - MIT_LICENSE: Full MIT license text
  - generate_index_html(): Generates a simple index.html page linking to assets

- Helper utilities
  - load_attachments(): Reads data.json and loads attachments (e.g., uid.txt) if provided. Supports data: URIs with base64 payloads.
  - write_text(), write_binary(): Helpers to write text and binary files
  - export_site(export_dir): Exports all assets into a static directory (output by default). Uses load_attachments() to include UID attachments if present.

- Flask app routes
  - / (index): Renders a small homepage linking to assets
  - /uid.txt: Serves the UID attachment content if provided via data.json; otherwise a plain message
  - /<path:filename>:
    - Serves assets from the repo root when present (needed files: ashravan.txt, dilemma.json, about.md, pelican.svg, restaurant.json, prediction.json, index.html, LICENSE, uid.txt)
    - If not present in the repo, it generates content on the fly for development:
      - ashravan.txt: ASHRAVAN_STORY
      - dilemma.json: DILEMMA_JSON
      - about.md: ABOUT_MD
      - pelican.svg: PELICAN_SVG
      - restaurant.json: RESTAURANT_JSON
      - prediction.json: PREDICTION_JSON
      - index.html: generated by generate_index_html()
      - LICENSE: MIT_LICENSE
  - index(): Simple HTML home giving quick access to assets
  - uid.txt (special): Uses load_attachments() to fetch attachment content if available

- __main__ entry point
  - If --export is in sys.argv, runs export_site(export_dir='output') within app context and then exits
  - Otherwise runs Flask in development mode on port 0.0.0.0:port with debug=True

Non-obvious routines:
- load_attachments() gracefully handles missing data.json and malformed data URIs, returning an empty dict if anything goes wrong.
- export_site() writes all assets, including a fallback for uid.txt if attachments are missing.
- The dynamic route (/<path:filename>) provides on-the-fly content for development when files aren’t present, making it easy to test without creating every file manually.

- MIT_LICENSE contains the MIT license text used by the LICENSE asset. It grants broad permission to use, modify, and distribute, with attribution and without warranty.
